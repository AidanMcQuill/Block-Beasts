# Block-Beasts
This App is finished with only a few shortcomings. I wasn't able to make the proper loop on lines 221 - 268. And I wasn't able to get around to the 
unit tests. The game is designed for the user to win off pure luck, The gimmick is just seeing what the best "beast" you can generate is. RNG is the key to victory.
You may struggle to win the first few battles but just keep restating until you start winning and you'll take off from there.

WARNING: After winning a battle make sure to input "1" or "2", any other key press will result in a crash. I was wasting too much time trying to figure out how to 
make a switch while loop, so I had to just cut my losses and move on.

If you have any questions please message me and I can answer them for you, Enjoy the game!
