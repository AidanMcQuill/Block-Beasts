The game is designed for the user to win off pure luck, The gimmick is just seeing what the best "beast" you can generate is. RNG is the key to victory.
You may struggle to win the first few battles but just keep restating until you start winning and you'll take off from there.

My program didn't have too many methods to use for unit tests, and most of them involved too much RNG to perform a selective test. 
I typed out one Unit Test, but that's about. 

(UPDATE TO THE WARNING) the menu still doesn't loop but it won't crash after entering a false input, instead it will just default to the 'No" option.
^ 
WARNING: After winning a battle make sure to input "1" or "2", any other key press will result in a crash. I was wasting too much time trying to figure out how to 
make a switch while loop, so I had to just cut my losses and move on.

If you have any questions please message me and I can answer them for you, Enjoy the game!
